Hello everyone.<br/><br/>
My name's Brandon Pollack, somehow you've reached my blog, hope I don't mislead you!

### What I write about

Software engineering mostly I think, perhaps some other topics.<br/><br/>
I often get myself caught up in wondering how something works, lose sleep figuring it out, all to forget it later.  Figured if I write it down others can use it and I can reference it :).
