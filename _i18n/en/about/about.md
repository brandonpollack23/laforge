Hello everyone.<br/><br/>
My name's Brandon Pollack, somehow you've reached my blog, hope I don't mislead you!

I also speak some Japanese, so I'm going to attempt to sharpen my skill by translating my posts to it.

### What I write about

#### Nerdy stuff

Software engineering mostly I think, perhaps some other topics.<br/><br/>
I often get myself caught up in wondering how something works, lose sleep figuring it out, all to forget it later.  Figured if I write it down others can use it and I can reference it :).

#### Even NERDIER stuff

I'll probably also write about Star Trek.  The quick run down of my opinions are:
* TOS is charming
* TNG is the greatest TV show of all time (never been topped)
* DS9 is amazing
* VOY is good
* ENT is great
* DIS and Kelvin are kinda bad.  Picard was almost as bad.
