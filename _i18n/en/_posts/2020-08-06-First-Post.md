This is my first post on the blog.  It should serve as a little tour.

I built this using Jekyll and build it locally and upload to my [laforge](http://github.com/brandonpollack23/laforge) repository.
The site's static content itself is (currently) just hosted on github pages directly [here](http://github.com/brandonpollack23/brandonpollack23.github.io). 
 I may move to my own hosting for fun at some point in the future, but this works fine for now.

I have disqus comments enabled for posts, but the different languages contain different discussions, so don't expect crossover!

I'm hoping to post about a few things, some I've outlined in about.  Hopefully my Japanese is good enough to be understood in that version of the site (see language dropdown in the header).

Thanks!
