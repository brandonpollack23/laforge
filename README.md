# My blog
Thought it would be fun to make/learn to use a sass.

# TODO BLOG
* Default.html: footer add "other language line" and make this from i18n
* Disqus
* Post tags
* First post.
* [Post serieses](https://digitaldrummerj.me/blogging-on-github-part-13-creating-an-article-series/)
* Toys section
* Make better style on language selector.
* use some means of page come from (cookie?) for 404
* Paginate posts in index.html

# TODO App/Self Host
* docker-compose.yml to deploy using jekyll docker and nginx
* I want to do account creation for fun, so I should look into keycloack or hydra (or roll my own simple accounts) and learn about *authorization* vs *authentication*, then deploy the app with docker in the compose file comments
  * I can just let members have a page with badges or something, this needs to be generated by my app.
* site made with jekyll should have the same max width as the blog
