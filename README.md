# My blog
Thought it would be fun to make/learn to use a sass.

# TODO
* Find a theme and migrate
* SEO and sitemap
* Multi lingual
* docker-compose.yml to deploy using jekyll docker and nginx
* I want to do account creation, so I should look into keycloack or hydra (or roll my own simple accounts) and learn about *authorization* vs *authentication*, then deploy the app with docker in the compose file
* comments
* site made with jekyll should have the same max width as the blog
